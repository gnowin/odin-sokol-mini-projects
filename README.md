# Odin and Sokol Mini-Projects
A collection of tiny projects I am working on that uses the Odin Programming Language and the cross-platform library Sokol.

## Prerequisites
To build and run these projects through the bash scripts, you need: 
- The [Odin Programming Language](https://github.com/odin-lang/Odin) installed and in your path.
- [sokol-odin](https://github.com/floooh/sokol-odin) and put it in the `shared` folder in your Odin install.
- [sokol-shdc](https://github.com/floooh/sokol-tools/blob/master/docs/sokol-shdc.md) for generating shaders. Standalone binary can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/floooh/sokol-tools-bin/tree/master/bin). This also needs to be in your path environment variable.

## Build and Run
Navigate to the root of the project through your terminal and run the following commands for each project.

### Scaled Canvas
`scaled-canvas/run.sh`

### Splines
`splines/run.sh`
